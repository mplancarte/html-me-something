      <header><h1>My Trip to New Orleans, Louisiana - January 2020</h1></header>
	<h4>By Miguel Plancarte</h4>
	<p>In January of this year me and four of my best friends took a road trip to New Orleans, Louisiana. My friends consisted of my partner Tomas, my sister Xochitl, and two great friends of Xochi's, Phallen &amp; Tommi. Together, we had an awesome trip that I will cherish for years to come. This is my third time visiting New Orleans, otherwise known as "The Big Easy" for it's laid-backness &amp; rich culture of food, music, and traditions. Here a few of my favorite places I visited and would recommend if you are planning a trip to The Big Easy!</p>

			<h2>Jean Lafitte Barataria Preserve</h2>
			<p>I love to experience the nature wherever I am visiting, I think it is the main reason that I love to travel. The Jean Lafitte National Historic and Preserve includes 26,000 acres of bayous, swamps, marshes, and forests. We decided to do an easy trail that was roughly 1 mile in length along the wetlands. Before we embarked on the trail I first stopped inside of the National Park office, where I was able to purchase my National Parks Passport. The idea is that once you buy the passport, you visit national parks collecting stamps of where you have gone! I really wish I would have purchased and gotten it stamped when I went to the Grand Canyon in 2019, where they were celebrating 100 years of operating! Nonetheless, I still enjoyed collecting my first stamp from Barataria Preserve. The wetlands are known for alligators and other wild life. Unfortantely we did not encounter any wild animals.

			<h2>Urban South Brewery</h2>
			<p>Another one of my favorite things to do when traveling to new places is going to craft breweries! I worked at a craft brewery for 6.5 years, so drinking craft beer is a huge part of my life. If you are from St. Louis, you might have heard of the brewery I worked at, Schlafly Beer. Schlafly is St. Louis's largest independent craft brewery and currently distributes in 15 states. Some of my favorite beer styles include India Pale Ales (IPAs), ciders, sours, and stouts. I have visited Urban South Brewery twice now, making it my favorite brewery in New Orleans. I ordered a sampler board of 5 mini beers to get to try a little bit of everything! After I finished my sampler I ordered a pint of my favorite sample, which was the Lime Cucumber Gose (pronounced "gose-uh"). A gose is a traditional German-style unfiltered sour wheat beer. I like sour beers because they are light and refreshing, to be enjoyed on a beautiful day.<br><br></p>

			<h2>Studio BE</h2>
			<p>Lastly, I enjoy visiting art museums when I make my way to new cities. In my hometown of St. Louis, I enjoy going to the Contemporary Art Museum (<a id="links" href="https://camstl.org/">CAM</a>), the Saint Louis Art Museum (<a id="links" href="https://www.slam.org/">SLAM</a>), and the <a id="links" href="https://camstl.org/">Pulizter Arts Foundation</a>. If you have not been to these museums, I highly recommend it! <br><br>Although I have visited the New Orleans Art Museum (NOMA), I definitely recommend Studio Be. Studio BE is a 35,000 sq ft warehouse that houses artist Brandan Odums first solo show, title "Ephemeral Eternal". The visual art housed inside of the warhouse depicts the stories of revolutionaries, heroes, and everyday New Orleanians. The five of us really enjoyed visiting the museum, as we spent almost 2 hours inside gazing at the murals of beautiful spray painted art.<br><br></p>
